//! Video settings that reach the window and the presentation path: 1.12's `gxWindow` and
//! `gxVSync` rows (`OptionsFrame.lua:14`, `:9`) and `gxResolution`, the windowed size and, in
//! fullscreen, the size the screen runs at.
//!
//! Deviation: `gxWindow "0"` is borderless fullscreen, not 1.12's exclusive mode-set at
//! `gxResolution`, because Wayland has no client mode-setting (winit ignores
//! `Fullscreen::Exclusive` there), X11's XRandR changes the desktop's mode and a crash leaves it
//! changed, and macOS has no exclusive mode. Bevy's `WindowMode::Fullscreen` also panics on a live
//! change that cannot resolve a monitor (`bevy_winit::winit_windows:91`, `system.rs:333`).
//!
//! The `gx*` rows are latched until `RestartGx()`, as in 1.12; a restart re-asserts them against
//! the window rather than re-creating the device, since wgpu reconfigures the surface live.
//!
//! Uncapped is `AutoNoVsync`, never `Immediate`: on Metal `Immediate` takes ~1 s `nextDrawable`
//! stalls ([`crate::capture::probe_uncap_mode`]).
//!
//! Deviation: on Windows, NVIDIA's Vulkan driver (610.88 seen) crashes inside `vkQueuePresentKHR`
//! on the first present after any swapchain resize while the present mode is `Fifo`, `FifoRelaxed`
//! or `AutoVsync` (a maximize is a resize). The fault is in the driver's own DXGI present
//! (`d3d11.dll`): it stays with `VK_LAYER_NV_present` disabled, and the validation layer reports
//! nothing before it. `Mailbox`, `AutoNoVsync` and DX12 survive, so there
//! "vsync on" is `AutoNoVsync` paced to the monitor's refresh rate ([`present_choice`]), which
//! keeps the synced look without the crash. `$WOW_PRESENT=fifo` restores plain `Fifo`.
